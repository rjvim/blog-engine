Why a Blogs Packages?

Blog feature has become very common in all websites these days. While for any website build on a CMS this feature is easily available, but in the other scenarios such as web-apps build on a different stack, implement Blogs is still a big task.

Implementing blogs require Database setup of its own kind, and while most of the plugins giving this functionality help with the tables setup, they take away the UI customisation, as most of the UI Becomes theme dependent.

With Betalectic blogs package, we will provide a basic backend architecture for the blogs feature. With some additional data to interact with the Data.

Later on we'll we working on developing a user dash board package which will serve as a companion package for this one.
